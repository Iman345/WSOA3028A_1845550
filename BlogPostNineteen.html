            An Application Programming Interface or an API  is responsible for “interactions between multiple software intermediaries”, the API works to serve as a point of communication between different applications. For example at a restaurant you order a milkshake from the kitchen. A waiter represents an API and will go to the kitchen, request your milkshake and bring it to your table. The waiter creates communication between you and the kitchen and an API serves a similar function. API’s offer functions that are independent of the project you may be working on and are used as foundations for developing software programs. API’s therefore enable people to easily reuse code and use code to rapidly develop applications. API’s enable connectivity and a relationship with effective communication between two different systems.

            For my project I decided to use an external framework to randomly provide famous quotes at the push of a button. The character, Suki, is experiencing life as we are now undergoing the stress of lockdown and isolation and can often find it difficult to be motivated in this situation, Therefore, Quotable API was implemented as an external dependency to offer words of inspiration to the character and her audience.  The character values different opinions and is passionate about offering the world food for thought,  With this implementation the audience can get what feels like unlimited food for thought from the website through the quotes. The technical implementation of this was straightforward and simple and works to give the character and her audience something to take-away from the website. There are multiple quote API’s available but most require a key and force you to take a much more steps in implementation.
