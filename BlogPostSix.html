        <h2> Hypertext</h2>
       
        <p>
         A basic understanding of hypertext is that it is simple text that contains a reference to access more information within the page or grant access to another page. Therefore using hypertext users are able to navigate from one page to another. 
         
        </p>
        
        <p> Hypertext is constrained to text only. Hypertext uses hyperlinks as the reference to other pages or additional information. Hyperlinks need to be clicked so that the user can change pages or location on a page.
 
        </p>
      
        <h2> Hyperlinks</h2>
       
       <p>
        A hyperlink appears within hypertext in order to serve as the portal that will redirect a user to a certain location within a webpage or take the user to an entirely different web page. 
       </p>
        <p>
            Hypertext is therefore a reference to other sources of text and works to efficiently allow the user to travel through web pages at a fast pace. 
        
       </p>

       <h2> Hypermedia</h2>
       
       <p>
        Hypermedia at basic level is a term used to describe text, audio, images, videos, graphics or data that we interact with via the web. Hypermedia is not constrained to being purely text-based while Hypertext is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hypermedia uses paths of connection between items that are non-linear, essentially working in the same way that Hypertext does. 

       </p>

      
       
       
       
       
        <h2>What is Metadata?</h2>
            <p> 
                Metadata is information that describes or summarises other information. Metadata is an important tool that is used as a means of communication between your website and search engines. Html makes use of metadata through the use of metatags.

            </p>
         <h2>What are Metatags? Why are they Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Meta tags serve as information that search engines use to understand what information your website contains. Additionally it also tells users useful information about what they may find on your page. This is important because Meta tags determine how your website will appear on search engine results pages which subsequently will determine the amount of users will engage with your website.
            </p>
            <p> Meta tags help ensure that your website is indexed correctly and appear in search results under the correct countries and languages that you determine. The way meta tags are used are dependent on the content of your website but they are a resource that is vital for your website's traffic and thus should not be neglected.
            </p>
