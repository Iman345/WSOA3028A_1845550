         This was the message displayed to users on the Independent Electoral Commission's (IEC's) Website who run all South African government elections. This message appeared since the creation of the website. The IEC not only failed to comply with global standards set by the W3C but violated the South african bill of rights. On the 28th of July 2008 a complaint was laid against the IEC with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) by Aslam Raffee, chair of government’s Open Source Software and Open Standards Working Group, alongside chief technical officer of Sita Daniel Mashao, and Helen King of The Shuttleworth Foundation. This claim was laid because the error message on the IEC website was an indication that South African citizens rights were being infringed.

        In a letter addressed to the HRC they outline how  the IEC website violated Human Rights. According to the Electoral Commission Act 1996, Section 9 (3) of the Bill of Rights , the state which (includes the state governed IEC)  is prohibited from discriminating against anyone on one or more grounds. The IEC message indicates that only Internet Explorer users can have access to the election information and thus anyone else is excluded, discriminating against people who do not use Microsoft.  Not only did the website only work on Internet Explorer but it only worked on Internet Explorer being used on Microsoft products further discriminating and excluding people.  Section 32 (1) (a) of the Bill of Rights asserts that all people have the right to information to state information and further violates the Bill of Rights by  favouring a specific proprietary vendor and guiding its citizens to buy from one particular vendor. Additionally, the website does not comply with the mandatory government approved MIOS (minimum interoperability standards)  policy on “free and open source software use for South African Government”. It does not adhere to the “standard version of html or xhtml”, and therefore is not compatible with any form of assistive technology. This is a prime example of the massive implications of creating a website void of ethical practice and web standards. It perfectly illustrates why web standards are necessary to avoid exclusion and create a more accessible web.
