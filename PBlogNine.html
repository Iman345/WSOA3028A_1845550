    <p>Here I am in University thinking that the males I am going to meet are going to have a higher emotional intelligence than a rock and more empathy and compassion than a slice of bread. WRONG. I am a naive fool, because if anything they are worse. I thought that going to the best university in South Africa, in Africa meant you had some sort of intellect, wrong again sure they can do math but do they know how to behave like decent human beings, afraid not. The university boys did not even wait a day to shatter my hopes and dreams, you see I went to a school that consisted only of people of colour so I was most alarmed upon meeting a white boy and hearing him say the N word amongst his friends, his white friends who just simply thought that was acceptable behaviour. From that day onwards the hetrosexual male population  just kept surprising me at how inhuman they actually are.</p>  
    <p>They live in a bubble where if it doesn't affect them they do not care and do not seem like they will make the effort to care any time soon. I am not even being judgemental when I say they don't have souls because they have shown me multiple times that they do not. Women in our country live in a constant state of fear and anxiety because there are barely any spaces in which you can let your guard down for even a moment. Violence, sexual harassment and abuse run rampant everywhere yet they will still come up to me and tell me with their whole chest how easy it is to be a girl. ”You just smile and get what you want”. So to try and educate them and show them that it is in fact nightmarish being a woman in the society we live in, we held a talk to discuss gender violence. Did all the ignorant misogynistic privileged men attend??? NO because again we are clowns for trying to see good in someone when they are very much happy to live without any social conscience or human decency, they haven't needed it till today so why would they bother. In conclusion, I do not like men and they do not not deserve rights.
