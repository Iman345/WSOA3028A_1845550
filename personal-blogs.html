        <h3> Post One, The Queen of England is a lizard person</h3>

    <p>I would like to begin by clarifying that this is infact not a conspiracy theory but a cold hard fact. The monarchy has always been suspected of having extra-terrestial communication but i think that's a rouse as aliens may or may not be kind. However, the monarchy stands for anything but kindness. Lizard people are shape-shifting, blood thirsty creatures who wrongfully proside in places of power. They feed on human beings and are trying to form a colont on Earth so one day they may take-over. Multiple children have gone missing after visiting the palace as well as staff. There is currently no technology that can identify or defend against lizard people. They are most likely to be wealthy and rich and will definately be Capatilist. Rich people are weird to begin with so do yourself a favour and stay away from them anyway. Beware of lizard people and keep your third-eye open.</p>
