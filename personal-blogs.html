        <h2> Post One, The origins of my name</h2>
        <p> Tuesday, <time datetime="1995-05-01">1 January 1995</time> by Suki Strawberry</p>
        </header> 
    <p> My mother was half Japanese and gave me the name, Suki. I lost contact with her along time ago but I did some research and it means the loved one, well I am hoping I my research correctly. My second name is Strawberry. That is my God given second name, well my parents do not believe in organised religion so apparently it is the Universes energy who decided to give me that name. In the commune I grew up in it was not a strange name with Rainbow, Zenneth and Xanadu running around but going to a mainstream school, I learnt that it is in fact, a laughable name. I was born at the same time as our communes first harvest of Strawberries and so it was deemed suitable by my mother, father and their spirit guides. However, I am grateful that it's Strawberry and not the scientfic name Fragaria Ã— ananassa, my mother was a botonist. I used to hate my name because it made me even weirder than I already was to all my classmates when I had to move from the commune to my aunts fancy house in the subarbs. I still think its ridiculous and completely uncharacteristic with my personality but it reminds of my life before the city and I will always have love for the memories of that life.</p>

        <h2> Post Two, The Queen of England is a lizard person</h2>
        <p> Tuesday, <time datetime="1995-05-03">3 January 1995</time> by Suki Strawberry</p>
        </header> 
    <p>I would like to begin by clarifying that this is infact not a conspiracy theory but a cold hard fact. If you stare at the Queen of England, you will catch a glimpse of her reptilian eyes. The monarchy has always been suspected of having extra-terrestial communication but i think that's a rouse. Besides aliens may or may not be kind. However, the monarchy stands for anything but kindness. Lizard people are shape-shifting, blood thirsty creatures who wrongfully proside in places of power. They feed on human beings and are trying to form a colony on Earth so one day they may take-over. Multiple children have gone missing after visiting the palace as well as staff. There is currently no technology that can identify or defend against lizard people. They are most likely to be wealthy and rich and will definately be Capatilist. Rich people are weird to begin with so do yourself a favour and stay away from them anyway and if you are rich already, do not trust anyone. Beware of lizard people and keep your third-eye open.</p>

    <p>This is my outfit of the week. Inspired by Wednesday Adams of the Adams family. I sewed the cape myself from a pattern in a knitting magazine. I found the magazine in my dentists office and borrowed the page from the magazine, if you wish to find the pattern I suggest you do the same. I wore this outfit to a poetry reading my dear and only friend Ken organised at a local coffee shop. It was painfully boring and did not speak to my soul. I hope everyone had a much more enlightening week. I noticed that no government agents followed me this week they must still be on holiday. Never forget they can always be watching so stay alert and keep your third-eye open. </p>

    <h2> Post Four, Website under construction</h2>

<p> This website is in its infancy of developement but it won't always be. Once I have the tools and the knowledge, it'll completely different. All the important information and conspiracies I discuss will be hidden from unwanted parties. Only those with their third-eye's open will be able to find the hidden information and uncover all the secrets this website will hold. I was thinking a simple black and white font so sensitive viewers won't be blinded by the colours. This site is meant for all (not the patriachy or any forms of "The Man". So i hope to make something that can reach a lot of people and open many eyes.)</p>
