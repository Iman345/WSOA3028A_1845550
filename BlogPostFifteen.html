        <h2>Blog Fifteen, The geographies of Information(Part One) </h2>

          The research paper  “Introduction: information geographies and (im)mutable augmentations”, thoroughly discusses the nature and the characteristics of information.The importance of this paper is that it gives insight to the way the world is sculpted by information’s geography and determines how we interpret and perceive the rest of the world outside of our own geography. 
        </p>    
    
        To understand the insight of the paper it is valuable to understand what information is. The paper begins by defining information. Information can be defined as a signal or character representing data (Miriam Webster), facts or details about someone or something (Oxford).Therefore, we can say that knowledge is born from information and knowledge is power therefore information has strong bindings to power and politics.

        <p>
              
            In a pre-digital, pre-mechanical era, information was spread by word of mouth through storytelling, handwritten books or papers. However, this means that the information was vulnerable to mutation and augmentation. This meant that if a story was told and it began to spread, it would be changed and altered (mutated) as it spread and there were no methods  to retain the stories original inherent qualities. Hand-written texts were also vulnerable to change as they are easily able to be altered but they were also limited to a select group of people.  Hand- written books and written works were reserved for scholars and the Church only and to have access to them, you would have to be able to read, live in a place where there are universities and Churches with resources and be of a certain pedigree or race to gain access to the institutes and subsequently the information. Those who produced information by writing down oral stories, or accounts of events were limited by who could read and write, who had the funds to purchase paper and ink and had the status to have their works shared in an academic or scholarly or societal sphere. Therefore, in a pre-digital, pre-mechanical age information was not easily accessible, mutable, and was limited in its manufacturing to those of power, wealth and social status. However, another important factor in accessibility, production of information and representation of information is the geography of information.

        
        </p> 

        The paper claims that information has/had and will always have geography. This statement means that embedded within every piece of information you interact with there is physical geography attached to it. Therefore information has a place of origin and a place of growth which shapes what the information is about and subsequently it that very piece of information that shapes its physical geography in turn. Information is therefore not just a reflection of a place it becomes an identity of that place and thus it shapes how that place is perceived by the outside world.

        <p>
            With the invention of the printing press and other similar devices to ICT technologies we know now, information is able to become immutable. Meaning that despite information being mobile and dynamic it is able to keep its core characteristics permanently. However now that information can be spread globally without vulnerability to mutation, power and politics forge an even stronger connection to information. Because those who manufacture, participate and have access to information possess the ability to shape how the world is seen and dictate what is what and what is not. Representation, participation and access are assessed in the paper to further illustrate the power dynamics of information geographies to illustrate how the digital era has or has not changed in terms of who is able to  represent, participate and access.

          “Information represented ‘this’ and not ‘that’(Schech 2002;Foucault 2000).”
          With the development of the web and internet, information can in some places be easily, quickly and relatively cheaply and more effectively be shared. This allows information to be spread and common understandings to be developed amongst people globally. Because information has growing global power because of the web, it is important to consider epistemic control in terms of the web. Epistemic control can be understood as having the power to control knowledge or anything in relation to knowledge. Therefore whoever has the most access, participation, and representation in regards to the web has the tightest grip on epistemic control. Because we assume the web has created equal opportunities for all, we assume epistemic control is not skewed however, that assumption is wrong and the opposite is true.  Before the digital age those with money, power and status in central geographies in the global north had the ability to produce and consume information.

        However, in the digital age you can produce and consume information from the comfort of your home without having to have to go to a scholarly institute. However, despite the assumptions that the internet has enabled global access, representation and participation, large inequality still exists. According to this study, epistemic control has not changed since the digital era, the West still has the most control over the production of information and therefore has the most epistemic control. How did this study reach this conclusion? By studying geographies of access, of participation, and of representation globally and comparing them. Despite ICT allowing easier access and participation, access and participation is not equal globally. This inequality of access, participation and representation indicates that certain countries produce information and by doing so can control knowledge about other places and thus the information they generate represents ‘this’ and not ‘that’(Schech 2002; Foucault 2000).” The west is still shaping the most information and therefore having the most say on what represents this and not that.
