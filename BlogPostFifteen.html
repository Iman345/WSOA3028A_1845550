          The research paper  “Introduction: information geographies and (im)mutable augmentations”, thoroughly discusses the nature and the characteristics of information.The importance of this paper is that it gives insight to the way the world is sculpted by information’s geography and determines how we interpret and perceive the rest of the world outside of our own geography. 
        </p>    
    
        To understand the insight of the paper it is valuable to understand what information is. The paper begins by defining information. Information can be defined as a signal or character representing data (Miriam Webster), facts or details about someone or something (Oxford).Therefore, we can say that knowledge is born from information and knowledge is power therefore information has strong bindings to power and politics.

        <p>
              
            In a pre-digital, pre-mechanical era, information was spread by word of mouth through storytelling, handwritten books or papers. However, this means that the information was vulnerable to mutation and augmentation. This meant that if a story was told and it began to spread, it would be changed and altered (mutated) as it spread and there were no methods  to retain the stories original inherent qualities. Hand-written texts were also vulnerable to change as they are easily able to be altered but they were also limited to a select group of people.  Hand- written books and written works were reserved for scholars and the Church only and to have access to them, you would have to be able to read, live in a place where there are universities and Churches with resources and be of a certain pedigree or race to gain access to the institutes and subsequently the information. Those who produced information by writing down oral stories, or accounts of events were limited by who could read and write, who had the funds to purchase paper and ink and had the status to have their works shared in an academic or scholarly or societal sphere. Therefore, in a pre-digital, pre-mechanical age information was not easily accessible, mutable, and was limited in its manufacturing to those of power, wealth and social status. However, another important factor in accessibility, production of information and representation of information is the geography of information.

        
        </p> 

        The paper claims that information has/had and will always have geography. This statement means that embedded within every piece of information you interact with there is physical geography attached to it. Therefore information has a place of origin and a place of growth which shapes what the information is about and subsequently it that very piece of information that shapes its physical geography in turn. Information is therefore not just a reflection of a place it becomes an identity of that place and thus it shapes how that place is perceived by the outside world.

        <p>
            With the invention of the printing press and other similar devices to ICT technologies we know now, information is able to become immutable. Meaning that despite information being mobile and dynamic it is able to keep its core characteristics permanently. However now that information can be spread globally without vulnerability to mutation, power and politics forge an even stronger connection to information. Because those who manufacture, participate and have access to information possess the ability to shape how the world is seen and dictate what is what and what is not. Representation, participation and access are assessed in the paper to further illustrate the power dynamics of information geographies to illustrate how the digital era has or has not changed in terms of who is able to  represent, participate and access.
