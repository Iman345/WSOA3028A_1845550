This week I will  attend a woman’s march for equal pay. I was asked by the event coordinator, a girl in one of my classes, to attend. I was always going to go because it’s a cause I believe in. I must say though it was quite wild that she called me to ask me to come. I have only one person who really calls me and that also happens to be my only friend Ken.When I answered the phone and made an unearthly sound thinking it was Ken or the strange person who calls me and breathes in the phone and then hangs up.  When I heard her  voice, I almost threw the landline across the room. It was a nice surprise but also she probably won’t call me again.

I’ve always wanted to be her friend, she’s really cool, she wears double denim and only a Spice girl can pull that off but she does it. She also always smells like a flower shop. She probably thinks I am just a crazy paranoid gloomy looney. I am only two of those things. She just did not need to get the confirmation about it before we even became real friends. Anyway I found this book about how to have conversations so I might be able to salvage a friendship out of the wreckage of terrible social manners.
