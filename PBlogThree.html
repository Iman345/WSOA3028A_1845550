<p> This website is in its infancy of developement but it won't always be. Once I have the tools and the knowledge, it'll be completely different. All the important information and conspiracies I discuss will be hidden from unwanted parties. Only those with their third-eye's open will be able to find the hidden information and uncover all the secrets that this website will hold. 
</p>

<p>I was thinking a simple black and white font so sensitive viewers won't be blinded by the colours. This site is meant for all (not the patriachy or any forms of "The Man") so I hope to make something that can reach a lot of people and open many eyes.</p>
