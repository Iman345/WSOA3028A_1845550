            A large number of the web development  community feel that the web is not growing at a healthy pace, standardization and the subsequent implementation is a thorough and highly lengthy process.Therefore, progress is slow and tedious. However, an evolutionary process has been proposed to ensure there is a higher speed of growth and that the growth is in the hands of the people. This attempt at evolving the web is called the Extensible Web Manifesto. This campaign aims to take a wide and diverse range of people who can offer different expertise, opinions and perspectives to work together on the future of the web. The Manifesto aims to nurture and grow  the present web and additionally protect the future of the web.

            The Extensible Web Manifesto website outlines the agenda of the manifesto as the following : standardizing new low-level capabilities, explaining existing features, creating a virtuous cycle and prioritizing efforts. Standardizing new low-level capabilities will allow systematic growth and easier implementation. Explaining existing features will allow people to understand low-level capabilities and therefore allow developers to copy and modify them and thus participate in growing the web. Creating a virtuous cycle by fostering a healthy relationship between standards and developers through allowing high-level features in JavaScript to be collaboratively created and tested by developers. Placing emphasis on webpages that enforce the manifesto to encourage participation.
