        <p> Since Vanevur Bush introduced the theoretical concept of the Memex (Bush, 1945), people have strived to bring the concept to life. Bush’s article “As We May Think” described a machine which could contain, store and retrieve a wealth of data and the way the machine would work would echo that of the human brain through linked pathways using association.
            This notion of programming information inspired Ted Nelson who was the first person to replicate a similar system through his invention of Hypertext.Ted Nelson’s invention was central and instrumental in TIm Berners-Lee’s creation of the internet (Mcpherson, 2009). Tim Berners-Lee is arguably one of the most significant and important scholars and inventors 
            in the past century because he invented the world wide web (WWW), an invention that has reshaped and evolved society in a great capacity.

            The World Wide Web or simply the Web was designed by Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN (The European Organization for Nuclear Research). While working at Cern Berners-Lee found that information was being handled in an ineffective and inadequately slow manner. This inspired Berners-Lee to fix the way information was being stored and shared. 
            He was particularly obsessed with one of his ideas which led to ENQUIRE and subsequently the Web. Berners-Lee’s specifications of HTML, HTTP and URI(URL) are still being used and developed everyday. Burners-Lee’s vision for the web entailed that it would be accessible and used globally by everyone.
