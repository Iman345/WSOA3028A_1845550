        Living in a country rooted in systemic racism and colonialism, I grew-up going to protests with my father. He always had a calm and collected hippy-dippy, easy going sort of nature but I saw all that melt away when he’d raise his fists at protests and replace his soft voice with battle cries. Even though I was little and could barely understand the concepts of discrimination and inequality, it was inspiring to watch people fight together for a cause they all believed in. Watching their fight inspired me. It inspired me never to become part of those who choose silence or surround myself with them.

        With the brutal murder of George Floyd  reigniting the flame of the Black Lives Matter protests has me re-evaluating those I have in my life as well as my faith in humanity. It’s got me questioning my faith because so many South Africans especially white south africans still hold the belief that it is not their struggle, that if they do not see it and if it does not personally affect them it is not their issue. That silence is ok. Silence has power, it does not leave you objective but rather gives your allegiance to the oppressive regimes operating our society. Silence fuels the fire of racism and inequality and in my eyes when someone says nothing,they’re just as vile and evil as those who would chant white lives matter or use an all lives matter hashtag.

        Police brutality against black people is not an american problem but a global one, furing under lockdown alone we have had eleven cases of police brutality against black people some resulting in fatalities within South Africa. Although we can not attend protests or gatherings we still have power, we the platforms to educate ourselves and offer our solidarity. Social media, art storytelling, signing petitions or just dialoging the issues and discussing them, we can all do something. This is a fight for all of us, there can be no justice or peace while Black Lives are treated with no humanity and the oppressive and racist regimes constructed to oppress them continue to brazenly operate everyday.

    Take a moment to sign the petitions to get justice for the Black Lives that were unjustly and tragically taken.
