        Technology has continuously evolved at a rapid past and has become an integral part of our lives, however, we do not sit to think about the relationship between our society and technology and who holds the power within the relationship. Technological and Social Determinism although they are polar opposites theoretically both argue an answer to that question. Technological Determinism argues that technology has the power and thus dictates how society progresses and what social and cultural values it adopts. An example that would support this is the way we walk. Before the invention of shoes with souls people walked toe first heel last. With the introduction of souls for shoes people began walking heel first, shaping the way we walk. Technological Determinism thus argues that technology evolves regardless of social,cultural or historical factors and that it is us who shape our lives, our cultural and social systems around the technology that is available to us.

        Social Determinism argues that Technological Determinism is false and that it is society that molds technology. Social Determinism states that social factors hold the power and therefore is directly responsible for how technology develops. An example of this would be the invention of the soul of the shoe to cater for a human need, therefore claiming that the invention was born from social factors. Technological Determinists would argue the invention would have occurred no matter what but the social determinists would argue that it was only invented because of social factors.

       It is important to discuss the nature of the relationship between society and technology because it would help us understand the very fabric of our society. In terms of software and interactive media, it is interesting to think about the evolution of the web in terms of technological and social determinism. It can be argued that Tim Berners-Lee created the web because of a social need, the need to share information efficiently however it can also be argued that this invention was inevitable regardless of social factors that would have made a reality at some point. Another question, is the evolution and growth of the web autonomous and inevitable? Or do we guide its growth according to our societal needs or is it a combination of both? If we are the ones responsible for the growth of the web, how can we guide the growth of the web? An exciting take on how we can drive the growth of the web is The extensible web manifesto.
