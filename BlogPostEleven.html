        <p>  UI or User Interface in this context is a term used to describe the visual elements that allows the user to interact with a web page. UI includes but is not limited to screens, typography, buttons, sounds ..etc. It is the interactional and presentational spheres of the webpage and therefore,  UI is the source of contact between the user and the product, it is the user's guide. The UI’s coherent aesthetic,  functionality, response and intuition determines the ease of the user's journey with the interface. The guide should therefore allow an easy journey through the webpage’s interface and not strain the user with confusion of navigating the interface because of  incoherence and inconsistency.  </p> 
        <p>
            UI is important as it is directly responsible for the user’s experience with the website.  The UI designer has similar responsibilities as programmers do, they should both ensure usability and accessibility to as many people as possible through their design practices. The Interface should be able to be used by a large and diverse group of people. Therefore, when designing a UI for a web page it is essential to consider as many cultures and communities as possible so that the user’s experience is pleasant and easy for as many people as possible.
