        “I don’t see colour” is the response I always get from people trying to show that they are not racist. Trying to reassure the person of colour that they do not hold their race against them. I used to think people who said that were ignorant but had good intentions but now   it’s always the answer that makes me want to throw my ten ton laptop at their face. In the age of technology and information, ignorance is not excusable or tolerable. </p>

    <p>

        “I don’t see colour” that answer in itself indicates the overwhelming amount of privilege you have to be able not to see colour, it's a luxury no person of colour can afford. When you walk into a store where the clerk watches your every step, you can't ignore the colour of your skin, when a police officer walks towards you, you can not ignore the colour of your skin or their skin. When you say you don't see colour what you really mean is I don't see my privilege and I choose to ignore the struggles of black people because it makes me uncomfortable. When someone says I don’t see colour it feels dismissive of the struggles that people of colour face, it's a convenient excuse to not talk about it, to remove yourself from the reality that colour determines whether you get that job or whether a policeman murders you or not.

    </p>
    <p>

        I don’t see colour is the poster boy for privilege and ignorance and anyone who seems to think it's an appropriate answer to any race related questions needs to open their eyes, they need to made uncomfortable, they need  to see that not seeing colour is not a signal that you are not racist or that you are an ally to people of colour, it is a sign of privilege.

    Take a moment to sign the petitions to get justice for the Black Lives that were unjustly and tragically taken.
