      <h2>Blog Post Two, The W3C</h2>

      When Tim Berners-Lee invented the web he had a vision for it. He wanted the Web to be a source of wealth for all people in terms of sharing and creating knowledge and information. In order to protect this vision of the web Berners-Lee founded the W3C.
    </p> 

    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium. The objective of this organisation is to protect and foster the potential and growth of the world wide web. The goal of the organisation is to actively try and shape the web so that everyone anywhere can use the web and  access it.  The W3C aims to protect and foster the Open web through web standards. Web standards are there so that websites can be “functional, accessible and cross-compatible” (Dickens, 2019) and therefore can be seen and used by more people.During the browser wars some websites worked better on Navigator while others only functioned on Internet Explorer. Therefore, websites were not as accessible as they could be. Web standards and the W3C exist to nullify this issue from occurring and ensure websites function at an optimal level on all browsers in the present and the future. However many people feel the W3C is not achieving their expressed objectives and thus people are diverging to the WHATWG.

    Although the W3C had goals and objectives that are noble, many felt they were slow in taking action to achieve their visions. However, that was not the controversy that caused people to leave the W3C and branch off to WHATWG.
  </p> 
  <p> 
    The W3C held a vote to determine whether they would use HTML or XHTML. When the decision was made and HTML was to be abandoned, HTML patriots created and joined the WHATWG. People felt that XHTML was rigid and stiff and thus it was not  as flexible and accessible as HTML is.
