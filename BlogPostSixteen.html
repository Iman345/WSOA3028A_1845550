            An automatic soap dispenser in a public bathroom has been identified as racist and found guilty by the public in a viral Twitter video. A black guest at the Marriott Hotel attending a convention was denied soap because the dispenser could not sense the man's hand because it was too dark for the dispenser to recognise. Naturally it easily dispensed soap to his light skinned companion with ease. It is clear that the team at Britain's Technical Concepts who designed it,  were all white and only tested it on white hands, which speaks to a major issue of a severe lack of diversity that runs rampant in the field of technology.

            Products and technology are created and made and tested by white people and thus it is geared towards white people. Whether this is intentional or not, the matter illustrates that people of colour are not part of the design or production process and therefore are not represented in the final product. This lack of diversity can easily be avoided by hiring black and people of colour to workforces in technological industries to make products more inclusive. This matter is of the utmost importance although the soap dispenser was taken in a humorous light as technology develops and is implemented into more spheres of life the consequences of racially biased products depends.  For example: facial recognition often mistakens people of colour for each other because it simply can not differentiate between them. It invades people's safety and privacy because sensitive information is carried by phones and if their facial recognition can not differentiate faces of colour the information they hold is not secure and safe. A more alarming example is the fact that police forces globally are beginning to use facial recognition technology to identify criminals or suspects and if the technology mistakes people of colour for each other the consequences are devastating as innocent people will be accused, incarcerated and implicated because technology continually fails people of colour. We often think of technology as neutral objects but the above examples clearly illustrate that this is not the case.

            Behind every piece of technology there is a programmer and  the danger lies with those who programme because their product takes on their position, ultimately producing narrow-minded algorithms that are biased.From software algorithms to infrared senses people of colour are excluded and ignored because they barely exist in a dominantly white field. The severity of this issue can not be stressed enough, people of colour need to be a dominant force in technology so that it takes on a more inclusive space in our society.
