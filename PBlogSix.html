        Today is the first day of school, I mean university. Well it's my first day of my second year. I have a list of goals for this year.

    </p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Make more friends. One friend min.</li>
        
        <li> Join a club that you did not start.
        </li>     
        
        
        <li>Get people to join the clubs you did start.
        </li>
        
        <li>Prove at least three of my “conspiracy theories”.
        </li>
        
        <li>Try to go to a gym.

        </li>
        
        <li>Look after a plant.
        </li>

        <li>
            Try overalls.

        </li>

        <li>
            Go to a concert


        </li>

        <li>
            Do something illegal
        </li>
        <li>
            Learn to cook

        </li>
        </ol> 
        
<p>
    I know some of my goals are unrealistic like number five and number three but it’s a new school year, maybe the force will work in my favour.
