        <h2>Blog Fourteen, Character Rationale </h2>

            The character who owns the website is a university student in the 90â€™s. The character is a conspiracy theorist who blogs about conspiracies, fashion and her own personal experiences growing up as a mixed race woman in South Africa. The character is highly opinionated and outspoken however she is also an introvert so the blogs will act as her voice. 

        </p>
            <p>
                The website will be black and white to keep with the characters gothic style and be minimal to try and emphasize what is most important to the character, conveying information and telling stories. With minimal distractions and a clean cut layout the users are able to focus on the stories and information within the websites blogs. 
                 
             </p>
             <p>

                Because the character is a conspiracy theorist there will also be an element of mystery through the use of hidden information within the blog. Hiding small icons on the website that reveal secret information or take the user to a hidden page. Because the character has dealt with exclusion throughout her life an extra effort will be made to try and include as many people as possible. Fonts, colour schemes, sectioning and programming will try and include not only people similar to the character but people who are differently abled and from different cultures.
             </p>
             <p>
              The website is also set in the 90's therefore it will stick to minimalism as the websites of that time were not very stylish.
