    <p>This is my outfit of the week. Inspired by Wednesday Adams of the Adams family. A personal hero of mine. I sewed the cape myself from a pattern in a knitting magazine. I found the magazine in my dentists office and borrowed the page from the magazine, if you wish to find the pattern I suggest you do the same. I wore this outfit to a poetry reading my dear and only friend Ken organised at a local coffee shop. It was painfully boring and did not speak to my soul. I hope everyone had a much more enlightening week. I noticed that no government agents followed me this week they must still be on holiday. Never forget they can always be watching so stay alert and keep your third-eye open. </p>
