    <p>This is my outfit of the week. Inspired by Wednesday Adams of the Adams family. A personal hero of mine. I sewed the cape myself from a pattern in a knitting magazine. I found the magazine in my dentists office and borrowed the page from the magazine, if you wish to find the pattern I suggest you do the same. I wore this outfit to a poetry reading my dear and only friend Ken organised at a local coffee shop. It was painfully boring and did not speak to my soul. I hope everyone had a much more enlightening week. I noticed that no government agents followed me this week they must still be on holiday. Never forget they can always be watching so stay alert and keep your third-eye open. </p>

<p>This week I attended a beautiful vineyard wedding of the most foul couple I know. I wore a Japanese inspired dress that I made myself and I sacrificed a bit of my rent for it. Well I did not exactly make it. I bought a really simple black dress from a thrift shop for a really cheap price. I went to the material shop near my house and bought some gold trim. I sewed the gold trim on the dress.</p>
<p>It looked terrible and so after I cried for a few hours I had to go find a replacement. I went to about five different thrift shops until finally I found a black dress and a shirt with oddly beautiful sleeves so I sewed the sleeves onto the black dress to take it from semi-casual to formal wear. The dress and the top cost double the price I paid for the first dress but it was of a higher quality so it was understandable. I just have to pick up more shifts at the video store. At least I'll look nice in the wedding pictures.

My outfit for my first day of school is a simple grunge look. Inspired by Magenta from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I made the skirt and the waistcoat out of an XXL jacket I found in the lost and found. I scrubbed it thoroughly, thrice. I bleached it and then coloured it red.  I feel like I know who lost it. It's this obnoxious guy in my art class who always hogs all charcoal and hairspray so i don't feel bad if it is his, it's what he deserves.  

</p>
<p>
    I polished my glasses, had my nails done and touched up my red highlights. This may be obvious but just a hint to keep in mind. When you use bleach and dye,  DO NOT wear white when you use it. It will never come off, your favourite white top will be lost forever. However, if you forget this, you can always use it as an excuse to try and dye the entire shirt red. That will be next week's adventure.

    This week I attended my first rave. I was unsure what attire was to be worn to an event like this.  So i read some magazines and was told that you are supposed to dress as wildly and freely as you wish with bright colours and light up components to the outfit. So in my humble opinion i made a really cool outfit that made me look like a disco ball which i thought was fitting for such a party. However, my best friend who I was accompanying did not agree and made me tone it down. </p>
<p>
    In the end I just wore a normal black skirt and shirt which felt very anti-climatic in comparison to my first outfit.  To spice up the outfit I drew fake tattoos on my arms and legs with my sharpie and Ken let me wear my cat socks so all was not lost. In conclusion I did not enjoy the rave, there are too many people, the music is weird but not in a good way and there is no food and people randomly burn things.I would not recommend this to anyone.
