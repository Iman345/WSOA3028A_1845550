    A considerable amount of literature has been published which predicted the internet and the world wide web, iconic works of literature  like “As We May Think” (1945)  by Vanevur Bush  and Marshall McLuhan’s Global Village.However Jorge Luis Borges predicted it in a far more entertaining manner compared to the coarse academic papers that prophesied it , Jorge did it through a short stories.

    Borges essentially says that the library of Babel contains all information or all literature that will and has ever existed but it is babel. It exists in a language we can not understand. However, there are many conspiracies within this tale that make it so enjoyable. The library is a metaphor for the universe, the secrets of the universe within the library are all encrypted but the narrator feels that in one of the books lies the decryption code for all the books. Another theorist within the story theories that the knowledge of the entire library could be held within one book with exceptionally thin pages. Many sources call Borges the prophet of the web because the singular book that contains the entire universes knowledge or the entire library can be thought of as a metaphor for the web.
