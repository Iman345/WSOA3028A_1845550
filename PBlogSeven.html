            If you don't believe the Bermuda triangle has mystical powers then please do not talk to me. I mean how many unexplainable things can happen in one place for it not to have some magical powers. My neighbour who used to babysit me told me all types of stories about the triangle, don’t worry I’ll share the stories. Planes, boats, ships, jets they’ve all vanished into thin air never to be seen again after passing the triangle. There’s hundreds of possibilities but I’ll make this quick and tell you the three most likely. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            1. The bermuda triangle is really just the protection spell protecting the land of Atlantis. When vehicles pass it the passengers of the vehicle are knocked out by the spell and suspended in the air or on the water, from there they are taken into Atlantis and their memories wiped, they live the rest of their lives as Atlantians. If any wreckage is found it has purposely been placed by Atlantians to lead us astray. 2. The second theory is that the Bermuda Triangle is a portal to another dimension/world/universe, however the portal is glitchy therefore it only opens at certain times so you may or may not disappear in the triangle. 3. Bad weather and human error. That was a joke by the way, there's no way it’s something that boring. The real third theory is that of the sea monsters. Giant cyclops, the kraken or some other massive sea thing lives there and eats anything that dares to destroy its peaceful sleep.

            So if you ever wanna visit the triangle you can expect one of the above scenarios, to be honest none of them sound particularly bad so if you ever want an exciting vacation you know where to go.
