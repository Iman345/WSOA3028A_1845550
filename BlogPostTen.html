            <h2>Accessibility
            </h2>
            Accessibility means that no matter what class, culture you may belong to and no matter what disabilities or conditions you face, you should still have the opportunity to access the web and any webpages. Accessibility should be a key force when developing any software or any product for that matter as the design should strive for maximum inclusion and nullify exclusion. There are many ways that programmers and UX designers and UI designers can create accessibility using their roles. Here are a few implementations that programmers can use.

        </p>
        <h2> ARIA</h2>
        <p>
            
            According to MDN Web docs  “accessibility is the idea that software (among other things) should be designed to be usable and, as much as possible”. 
            Accessibility is about not only to people whose needs are similar to your own but people who are differently abled and have different needs to yourself. It is considering how different languages, scripts and cultures can not feel excluded but included.
            
        </p>

          <p> 

            Therefore, accessibility means taking into account as many needs as possible to ensure your website is usable and usable to a wide and diverse range of people. Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) are attributes that specifically strive towards creating a web that is accessible to those who are disabled. Where HTML falls short by not being able to specify certain information. ARIA works to specify attributes in order for a screen renderer to be given the missing information basic HTML can not give. As web developers it is ethical to utilize ARIA to make your website as inclusive as possible.

        <p>
            The web is a global tool. Therefore, it is essential that the needs of different cultures be understood and taken into consideration during the design process. An accessible website must look beyond your own needs and support a global community. The W3C Internationalization Activity aims to ensure that web technologies are compatible and support different languages, scripts and cultural needs.
