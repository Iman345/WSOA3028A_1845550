        Now that COVID19 has hit South Africa in full force and we are under lockdown. My day is significantly different as I am sure everyone else's is. I appreciate life so much more, I miss looking for government agents in crowds. I miss going to cafes and staring at old white ladies staring at me. I miss wandering around school looking for the hidden cameras and eating donuts on steps while graffiti Adam Habib sucks on the walls. It's the little things that I miss, I even kind of miss people. I miss the annoying boys in my class, I miss rolling my eyes at them and their even more annoying friends who come into our class and sit on our good chairs and sleep on our tables and talk while I am trying to pretend to understand what the frick frack Ethics are.

        I understand that this is necessary though. We need to stay inside and wear masks if we need to go out and try our best not to go out. Itâ€™s a time not to be selfish because while I can recover, the person I could pass it to might have heart issues and is at a greater risk. So I hope everyone remembers and considers others in this pandemic. It's a tough time for everyone and I personally find online schooling excruciatingly difficult and I know I am not alone, so whatever you are going through I hope you reach out to someone and talk about it because you are not alone in this struggle, this is our global struggle. Take good care of yourself and I hope everyone adheres to the lockdown rules, if not for  yourself, do it for the people around you.
