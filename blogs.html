    <p>The World Wide Web</p>
        <p> Since Vanevur Bush introduced the theoretical concept of the Memex (Bush, 1945), people have strived to bring the concept to life. Bush’s article “As We May Think” described a machine which could contain, store and retrieve a wealth of data and the way the machine would work would echo that of the human brain through linked pathways using association. This notion of programming information inspired Ted Nelson who was the first person to replicate a similar system through his invention of  Hypertext. Ted Nelson’s invention was central and instrumental in TIm Berners-Lee’s creation of the internet (Mcpherson (2010). Tim Berners-Lee is arguably one of the most significant and important scholars and inventors in the past century because he invented the world wide web (WWW), an invention that has reshaped and evolved society in a great capacity. The World Wide Web or simply the Web was designed by Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN (The European Organization for Nuclear Research). While working at Cern Berners-Lee found that information was being handled in an ineffective and inadequately slow manner. This inspired Berners-Lee to fix the way information was being stored and shared. He was particularly obsessed with one of his ideas which led to ENQUIRE and subsequently the Web. Berners-Lee’s specifications of HTML, HTTP and URI(URL) are still being used and developed everyday. Burners-Lee’s vision for the web entailed that it would be accessible and used globally by everyone.

        When Tim Berners-Lee invented the web he had a vision for it. He wanted the Web to be a source of wealth for all people in terms of sharing and creating knowledge and information. In order to protect this vision of the web Berners-Lee founded the W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium. The objective of this organisation is to protect and foster the potential and growth of the world wide web. The goals of the organisation is to actively try and shape the web so that everyone anywhere can use the web and  access it.  The W3C aims to protect and foster the Open web through web standards. Web standards are there so that websites can be “functional, accessible and cross-compatible” and therefore can be seen and used by more people.During the browser wars some websites worked better on Navigator while others only functioned on Internet Explorer. Therefore, websites were not as accessible as they could be. Web standards and the W3C exist to nullify this issue from occurring and ensure websites function at an optimal level on all browsers in the present and the future. However many people feel the W3C is not achieving their expressed objectives and thus people are diverging to the WHATWG.
