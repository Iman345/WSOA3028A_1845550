        <p> Since Vanevur Bush introduced the theoretical concept of the Memex (Bush, 1945), people have strived to bring the concept to life. Bush’s article “As We May Think” described a machine which could contain, store and retrieve a wealth of data and the way the machine would work would echo that of the human brain through linked pathways using association. This notion of programming information inspired Ted Nelson who was the first person to replicate a similar system through his invention of Hypertext....

        <h2>Blog Post Two, The W3C</h2>

        When Tim Berners-Lee invented the web he had a vision for it. He wanted the Web to be a source of wealth for all people in terms of sharing and creating knowledge and information. In order to protect this vision of the web Berners-Lee founded the W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium. The objective of this organisation is to protect and foster the potential and growth of the world wide web. The goals of the organisation is to actively try and shape the web so that everyone anywhere can use the web and  access it.  The W3C aims to protect and foster the Open web through web standards. Web standards are there so that websites can be “functional, accessible and cross-compatible” and therefore can be seen and used by more people.During the browser wars some websites worked better on Navigator while others only functioned on Internet Explorer. Therefore, websites were not as accessible as they could be. Web standards and the W3C exist to nullify this issue from occurring and ensure websites function at an optimal level on all browsers in the present and the future. However many people feel the W3C is not achieving their expressed objectives and thus people are diverging to the WHATWG.

        <h2>Blog Post Two and a half, The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</h2>

        Although the W3C had goals and objectives that are noble, many felt they were slow in talking action to achieve their visions. However, that was not the controversy that caused people to leave the W3C and branch off to WHATWG. The W3C held a vote to determine whether they would use HTML or XHTML. When the decision was made and HTML was to be abandoned, HTML patriots created and joined the WHATWG. People felt that XHTML was rigid and stiff and thus it was not  as flexible and accessible as HTML is.

        <h2>Case study blog on web standards and the IEC</h2>
        <p> Friday, <time datetime="2020-25-02">29 Feb 2020</time> by Suki Strawberry</p>

   <p> “Welcome to the IEC web site! Our server detected that you are using a browser or operating system (e.g. Netscape, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome etc.) which is currently incompatible with our website. The current website is only compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer V4 (and upward) on the Windows operating system. The website is under construction in order to rectify this. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.” 

    This was the message displayed to users on the Independent Electoral Commission's (IEC's) Website who run all South African government elections. This message appeared since the creation of the website. The IEC not only failed to comply with global standards set by the W3C but violated the South african bill of rights. On the 28th of July 2008 a complaint was laid against the IEC with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) by Aslam Raffee, chair of government’s Open Source Software and Open Standards Working Group, alongside chief technical officer of Sita Daniel Mashao, and Helen King of The Shuttleworth Foundation. This claim was laid because the error message on the IEC website was an indication that South African citizens rights were being infringed. In a letter addressed to the HRC they outline the how that the IEC website violated Human Rights. According to the Electoral Commission Act 1996, Section 9 (3) of the Bill of Rights , the state which (includes the state governed IEC)  is prohibited from discriminating against anyone on one or more grounds. The IEC message indicates that only Internet Explorer users can have access to the election information and thus anyone else is excluded, discriminating against people who do not use Microsoft.  Not only did the website only work on Internet Explorer but it only worked on Internet Explorer being used on Microsoft products further discriminating and excluding people.  Section 32 (1) (a) of the Bill of Rights asserts that all people have the right to information to state information and further violates the Bill of Rights by  favouring a specific proprietary vendor and guiding its citizens to buy from one particular vendor. Additionally, the website does not comply with the mandatory government approved MIOS (minimum interoperability standards)  policy on “free and open source software use for South African Government”. It does not adhere to the “standard version of html or xhtml”, and therefore is not compatible with any form of assistive technology. This is a prime example of the massive implications of creating a website void of ethical practice and web standards. It perfectly illustrates why web standards are necessary to avoid exclusion and create a more accessible web.

          <h2>Blog Five, The Browser Wars</h2>
          <p> Saturday, <time datetime="2020-30-02">26 Feb 2020</time> by Suki Strawberry</p>
      </header> 

<p>The aim of this blog  is to provide my understanding on one of the most iconic events in internet history, the First Browser war between Netscape’s Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. However, it is important to assess each browser's origins before discussing the Browser Wars in depth. 

    Interestingly Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape’s Navigator have the same origin story, they were both born from Mosaic. NCSA’s ( National Center for Supercomputing Applications)  Mosaic , was developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina under the University of Illinois. Mosaic was revolutionary because it allowed text and images to appear on the same page, during that time a transformative and completely new creation. It was easy to install and integrated well with operating systems. However, Mosaic was owned by the University of Illinois thus its creators had no right to its name. Therefore, when Andreesan left the NCSA and moved to Silicone Value, he teamed up with computer scientist, Jim Clark to form a new company. Initially they called the company  Mosaic Communications Corporation, however they had to completely transform every aspect of their company due to the University of Illinois owning the rights and licensing to Mosaic. The company started from scratch rebuilding their vision as Netscape Communications. Netscape developed Navigator as a superior browser from the foundation of Mosaic. In 1995, Micrsofot bought the licensing for NSCA’s Mosaic and used it to develop Internet Explorer. Therefore, both web browsers originated from Andreesan and his team.  
    
    December 15 1994, Netscape Communications released their developed browser a called Navigator. On  a popular question-and-answer website Quora a user asked “How important was Netscape? ”, to which former Netscape employee JavaScript creator and Mozilla co-founder, Brendan Eich, answered “To say Netscape did not "change history" is to say Napoleon (even though he failed -- twice!) did not change history”. As Eich points out, Netscape did not only create invaluable technological advancement by introducing Secure Sockets Layer (SLL), cookies and Javascript (JS) but changed the world economically and culturally. It was revolutionary because the web was so young it was hard to navigate and guide in a user friendly way but Navigator presented the opportunity for users to utilize the web in an entirely more effective and understandable manner with higher rates of speed. It popularized web surfing to a much larger extent than Mosaic did. Therefore, Navigator transformed the way we received and shared information on the web as well as who received and shared information by appealing to the masses. 
    
    By the end of 1995 Netscape had coined ninety percent of the user market (Windum, 2004, 385-394) and was dominating the field.  The company was thriving as a multimillionaire corporation in such a short time. In 1995 only after a year of operation, Netscape went public on the stock market furthering its growth as a giant. However, it is in that same year that Microsoft included Internet Explorer 1.0 in Windows 95 in an add-on Pack.   Microsoft became a rival to Navigator,  IE’s threat would only continue to grow as the years went by until Netscape's demise. Many people argue about the exact reasons Microsoft was able to completely ruin a company that held ninety percent of the market. Microsoft bundling IE with their operating system software for free while Navigator still came at a cost was one way Microsoft competed. Netscape refused to bundle or give Netscape away for free but tried to compete by upgrading and adding features to Navigator. However, this effort was negated when Microsoft included those features and kept up with Navigator meaning Netscape was unable to prevent Microsoft from catching up with them and taking over the user market. By 1997, Netscape only held 39% of the market (DataQuest, 1997) and by 1999 it had dropped significantly to 23%(Statmarket, 1999).  March 31, 1998 Netscape released their source code for their browser. An action that in turn ran Microsoft into the minority of the user market in the years to come. Struggling to compete and retake the title of the most used browser, AOL still saw potential in Netscape and bought the company for $4.2 billion during November. The company's new management only further staggered the browsers' losses by cutting down its workforce.  By 2001 Netscape ceased to exist however its impact still remains with us today. The Browser Wars will always be significant because without them iconic moments like Microsoft's antitrust suit and the creation of the Mozilla Project and Firefox might have never occurred.

          <h2>Blog Six, The Library of Babel</h2>
          <p> Saturday, <time datetime="2020-30-02">26 Feb 2020</time> by Suki Strawberry</p>
      </header> 

<p>A considerable amount of literature has been published which predicted the internet and the world wide web, iconic works of literature  like “As We May Think” (1945)  by Vanevur Bush  and Marshall McLuhan’s Global Village.However Jorge Luis Borges predicted it in a far more entertaining manner compared to the coarse academic papers that prophesied it , Jorge did it through a short stories. Borges essentially says that the library of Babel contains all information or all literature that will and has ever existed but it is babel. It exists in a language we can not understand. However, there are many conspiracies within this tale that make it so enjoyable. The library is a metaphor for the universe, the secrets of the universe within the library are all encrypted but the narrator feels that in one of the books lies the decryption code for all the books. Another theorist within the story theories that the knowledge of the entire library could be held within one book with exceptionally thin pages. Many sources call Borges the prophet of the web because the singular book that contains the entire universes knowledge or the entire library can be thought of as a metaphor for the web.
