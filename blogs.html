        <h2>Blog Post One, The World Wide Web</h2>

        <p> Since Vanevur Bush introduced the theoretical concept of the Memex (Bush, 1945), people have strived to bring the concept to life. Bush’s article “As We May Think” described a machine which could contain, store and retrieve a wealth of data and the way the machine would work would echo that of the human brain through linked pathways using association. This notion of programming information inspired Ted Nelson who was the first person to replicate a similar system through his invention of  Hypertext. Ted Nelson’s invention was central and instrumental in Tim Berners-Lee’s creation of the internet (Mcpherson (2010). Tim Berners-Lee is arguably one of the most significant and important scholars and inventors in the past century because he invented the world wide web (WWW), an invention that has reshaped and evolved society in a great capacity. The World Wide Web or simply the Web was designed by Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN (The European Organization for Nuclear Research). While working at Cern Berners-Lee found that information was being handled in an ineffective and inadequately slow manner. This inspired Berners-Lee to fix the way information was being stored and shared. He was particularly obsessed with one of his ideas which led to ENQUIRE and subsequently the Web. Berners-Lee’s specifications of HTML, HTTP and URI(URL) are still being used and developed everyday. Burners-Lee’s vision for the web entailed that it would be accessible and used globally by everyone.

        <h3>Blog Post Two, The W3C</h3>

        When Tim Berners-Lee invented the web he had a vision for it. He wanted the Web to be a source of wealth for all people in terms of sharing and creating knowledge and information. In order to protect this vision of the web Berners-Lee founded the W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium. The objective of this organisation is to protect and foster the potential and growth of the world wide web. The goals of the organisation is to actively try and shape the web so that everyone anywhere can use the web and  access it.  The W3C aims to protect and foster the Open web through web standards. Web standards are there so that websites can be “functional, accessible and cross-compatible” and therefore can be seen and used by more people.During the browser wars some websites worked better on Navigator while others only functioned on Internet Explorer. Therefore, websites were not as accessible as they could be. Web standards and the W3C exist to nullify this issue from occurring and ensure websites function at an optimal level on all browsers in the present and the future. However many people feel the W3C is not achieving their expressed objectives and thus people are diverging to the WHATWG.

        <h4>Blog Post Two and a half, The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</h4>

        Although the W3C had goals and objectives that are noble, many felt they were slow in talking action to achieve their visions. However, that was not the controversy that caused people to leave the W3C and branch off to WHATWG. The W3C held a vote to determine whether they would use HTML or XHTML. When the decision was made and HTML was to be abandoned, HTML patriots created and joined the WHATWG. People felt that XHTML was rigid and stiff and thus it was not  as flexible and accessible as HTML is.

        <h5>Case study blog on web standards and the IEC</h5>
        <p> Friday, <time datetime="2020-25-02">29 Feb 2020</time> by Suki Strawberry</p>

   <p> “Welcome to the IEC web site! Our server detected that you are using a browser or operating system (e.g. Netscape, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome etc.) which is currently incompatible with our website. The current website is only compatible with Microsoft Internet Explorer V4 (and upward) on the Windows operating system. The website is under construction in order to rectify this. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.” 

    This was the message displayed to users on the Independent Electoral Commission's (IEC's) Website who run all South African government elections. This message appeared since the creation of the website. The IEC not only failed to comply with global standards set by the W3C but violated the South african bill of rights. On the 28th of July 2008 a complaint was laid against the IEC with the Human Rights Commission (HRC) by Aslam Raffee, chair of government’s Open Source Software and Open Standards Working Group, alongside chief technical officer of Sita Daniel Mashao, and Helen King of The Shuttleworth Foundation. This claim was laid because the error message on the IEC website was an indication that South African citizens rights were being infringed. In a letter addressed to the HRC they outline the how that the IEC website violated Human Rights. According to the Electoral Commission Act 1996, Section 9 (3) of the Bill of Rights , the state which (includes the state governed IEC)  is prohibited from discriminating against anyone on one or more grounds. The IEC message indicates that only Internet Explorer users can have access to the election information and thus anyone else is excluded, discriminating against people who do not use Microsoft.  Not only did the website only work on Internet Explorer but it only worked on Internet Explorer being used on Microsoft products further discriminating and excluding people.  Section 32 (1) (a) of the Bill of Rights asserts that all people have the right to information to state information and further violates the Bill of Rights by  favouring a specific proprietary vendor and guiding its citizens to buy from one particular vendor. Additionally, the website does not comply with the mandatory government approved MIOS (minimum interoperability standards)  policy on “free and open source software use for South African Government”. It does not adhere to the “standard version of html or xhtml”, and therefore is not compatible with any form of assistive technology. This is a prime example of the massive implications of creating a website void of ethical practice and web standards. It perfectly illustrates why web standards are necessary to avoid exclusion and create a more accessible web.
