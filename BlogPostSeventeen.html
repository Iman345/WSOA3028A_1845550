            Robinson discusses a relatively new but increasingly important inequality facing global society, Digital Inequality. Robinson presents the argument that the issue of digital equality deserves to be treated with the same severity and urgency as other inequalities that humankind face such as class, race and gender inequalities.It is a matter that should not only concern those within the software, technological spheres but within the social sciences as well, as the internet has become an essential part of society. Robinson additionally discusses the direct correlation between digital inequalities and other forms of societal inequality such as class, race and gender.

            Robinson makes the point that even in countries considered first world countries with high rates of technological integration and access, the minorities and marginalized communities who face inequality in society are still more prone to digital inequality and that their inequality is further sustained digitally. Robinson carefully examines the relationships between digital inequalities and societal inequalities and compares the differences and similarities. For the sake of this blog, Robinson’s exploration of Gender will be discussed.

            Robinson’s paper takes research done in developed countries to discuss the gaps between men and women in a digital space and how the offline divide and behaviours of men and women is mimicked digitally. Despite having equal access, inequality still exists and the inequality online of each country echoes that of the inequality offline. Robinson discusses women in online space like RPGs as being forced into stereotypical bodies and characters taking the passive role and objectified role. Women use the internet to while men use the internet to Women use the internet less and less intensely, performing less activities on the internet and underestimating their internet skills in comparison to men. This has consequences because women will continue to use the internet less and choose fields outside of ICT because they do not think they are well equipped in skill. Another concerning result within Robinsons research is the fact that men still dominate and control the IT sector in every sphere. Robinson predicts that this vast inequality will persist in our society for approximately another decade. Despite belonging to first world countries women are still discriminated against and cast aside in a male dominated IT industry which will continue if this industry sustains its current structures and behaviours.Robinson thus illusrtates the inequality between men and women in perpetrates into internet behaviours and norms.
