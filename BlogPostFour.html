    The aim of this blog  is to provide a clear understanding of one of the most iconic events in internet history, the First Browser war between Netscape’s Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. However, it is important to assess each browser's origins before discussing the Browser Wars in depth. 

</p>

<p>

    Interestingly Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Netscape’s Navigator have the same origin story, they were both born from Mosaic. NCSA’s ( National Center for Supercomputing Applications)  Mosaic , was developed by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina under the University of Illinois. Mosaic was revolutionary because it allowed text and images to appear on the same page, during that time a transformative and completely new creation. It was easy to install and integrated well with operating systems. However, Mosaic was owned by the University of Illinois thus its creators had no right to its name. Therefore, when Andreesan left the NCSA and moved to Silicone Value, he teamed up with computer scientist Jim Clark,  to form a new company. Initially they called the company  Mosaic Communications Corporation, however they had to completely transform every aspect of their company due to the University of Illinois owning the rights and licensing to Mosaic. The company started from scratch rebuilding their vision as Netscape Communications. Netscape developed Navigator as a superior browser from the foundation of Mosaic. In 1995, Micrsofot bought the licensing for NSCA’s Mosaic and used it to develop Internet Explorer. Therefore, both web browsers originated from Andreesan and his team.

    December 15 1994, Netscape Communications released their developed browser called Navigator. On  a popular question-and-answer website Quora a user asked “How important was Netscape? ”, to which former Netscape employee JavaScript creator and Mozilla co-founder, Brendan Eich, answered “To say Netscape did not "change history" is to say Napoleon (even though he failed -- twice!) did not change history”. As Eich points out, Netscape did not only create invaluable technological advancement by introducing Secure Sockets Layer (SLL), cookies and Javascript (JS) but changed the world economically and culturally. It was revolutionary because the web was so young it was hard to navigate and guide in a user friendly way but Navigator presented the opportunity for users to utilize the web in an entirely more effective and understandable manner with higher rates of speed. It popularized web surfing to a much larger extent than Mosaic did. Therefore, Navigator transformed the way we received and shared information on the web as well as who received and shared information by appealing to the masses.

    By the end of 1995 Netscape had coined ninety percent of the user market (Windum, 2004, 385-394) and was dominating the field.  The company was thriving as a multimillionaire corporation in such a short time. In 1995 only after a year of operation, Netscape went public on the stock market furthering its growth as a giant. However, it is in that same year that Microsoft included Internet Explorer 1.0 in Windows 95 in an add-on Pack.   Microsoft became a rival to Navigator,  IE’s threat would only continue to grow as the years went by until Netscape's demise. Many people argue about the exact reasons Microsoft was able to completely ruin a company that held ninety percent of the market. Microsoft bundling IE with their operating system software for free while Navigator still came at a cost was one way Microsoft competed. Netscape refused to bundle or give Netscape away for free but tried to compete by upgrading and adding features to Navigator. However, this effort was negated when Microsoft included those features and kept up with Navigator meaning Netscape was unable to prevent Microsoft from catching up with them and taking over the user market. By 1997, Netscape only held 39% of the market (DataQuest, 1997) and by 1999 it had dropped significantly to 23%(Statmarket, 1999).  March 31, 1998 Netscape released their source code for their browser. An action that in turn ran Microsoft into the minority of the user market in the years to come. Struggling to compete and retake the title of the most used browser, AOL still saw potential in Netscape and bought the company for $4.2 billion during November. The company's new management only further staggered the browsers' losses by cutting down its workforce.  By 2001 Netscape ceased to exist however its impact still remains with us today. The Browser Wars will always be significant because without them iconic moments like Microsoft's antitrust suit and the creation of the Mozilla Project and Firefox might have never occurred.
