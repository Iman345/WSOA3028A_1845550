            Pigeons are evil government agents and no one can change my mind. They are everywhere, they’re always lurking and watching and waiting. Just look at them, they look like the embodiment of evil. They’re beady dead eyes are just camera’s and their cooing are signals that only the government can transmit and understand. They are here to monitor us and evaluate us. That’s why when I encounter pigeons on the street my first instinct is to run. I don’t want the government to be aware that I am aware of their schemes so I never retaliate.  </p> 
    
        <p>
            I do believe that there are normal natural pigeons like non-government manufactured pigeons. The government pigeons blend in with them so we can not tell the difference and that's why I attempt to capture a pigeon to prove my theory. I do not want to traumatise a normal pigeon that's just trying to go about its day. Even the normal ones freak me out though so moral of the story is that you should not trust pigeons. They can stand on electric fences and they don’t blink so be very wary.
