        <h2> Post One, The origins of my name</h2>
        
        <p> Tuesday, <time datetime="1995-05-01">1 Jan 1995</time> by Suki Strawberry</p>

    <p> My mother was half Japanese and gave me the name, Suki. I lost contact with her along time ago but I did some research and it means the loved one, well I am hoping I my research correctly. My second name is Strawberry. That is my God given second name, well my parents do not believe in organised religion so apparently it is the Universes energy who decided to give me that name. In the commune I grew up in it was not a strange name with Rainbow, Zenneth and Xanadu running around but going to a mainstream school, I learnt that it is in fact, a laughable name. </p>

<p>I was born at the same time as our communes first harvest of Strawberries and so it was deemed suitable by my mother, father and their spirit guides. However, I am grateful that it's Strawberry and not the scientfic name Fragaria Ã— ananassa, my mother was a botonist. I used to hate my name because it made me even weirder than I already was to all my classmates when I had to move from the commune to my aunts fancy house in the subarbs. I still think its ridiculous and completely uncharacteristic with my personality but it reminds of my life before the city and I will always have love for the memories of that life.
