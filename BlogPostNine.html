            Eric Steven Raymond famously known as ESR is a software engineer famous who is well known for his highly acclaimed essay the Cathedral and the Bazaar and his book by the same name. The book is essential in terms of how we look at the internet and software development.  The book argues against the Cathedral style and favours the Bazaar style. The Cathedral style is a single styled approach, one exclusive team creates and works on the production of a product from its initial stages to its finalization.
        </p> 

        The Bazaar style is directly derived from Linux project creator Linus Torvalds model of creation. Linus’s model saw that users were not just viewed as consumers but potential co-developers. Linus released his code and released his code often and thus through collaboration issues such as bugs were efficiently and rapidly solved. This can be summarised by Raymond in what he claims as Linus’s law,  "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."  Therefore, Bazaar style concludes that collaboration is an essential and smart tool to use in terms of software development.

            In conclusion, utilizing the diverse knowledge, opinions, skills  and perspectives of your community can give you tremendous results in a cost-effective, fast manner proving a nosy busy bazaar can prove more valuable than a quietly constructed cathedral.
