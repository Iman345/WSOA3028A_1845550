<p>This week I had a wedding to attend. It was at a vineyard that was almost magical. The flowers were in bloom and everything was summery and green. I sat in the table way at the back even though I lived with the bride for ten years. Although the family dentist and the groom's mistress were strangely the best company. My atrocious first cousin Karen got married to her vile boyfriend Richard. Don’t they already sound like a nightmare.</p> </article>
<p>
    I can only imagine what horrendous offspring they’re going to bring into this world. If you want a taste of what karen is like. Imagine an old lady with a walker and a ventilator makes it to the supermarket and is going towards the very last packet of Marie Biscuits on the shelf. As she reaches up for the Marie biscuits a freshly manicured hand reaches out for them as well. The granny thinks oh how sweet this young woman is helping me get my biscuits. WRONG. The woman plops the biscuit in her trolly and looks at the granny and smiles as she trots towards the manager to complain about something. That’s Karen in a nutshell. Don’t let me get started on her boyfriend, Richie. Karen is only one of his girlfriends and unfortunately for her,  the one he chose to marry.
</p>
<p>
    She gets the pleasure of polishing all his Soccer trophies and going to his little white supremacy club but according to them they call it the “country club”. He makes karen look like a decent human being. When I see his smug face all I want to do is punch it clean off his face and take his new golf clubs and smash his Porsche windows with it. If he calls me Kiki one more time, I swear I will. One good thing of this union forged in hell, perhaps he will migrate back to England and take Karen with him. They can be Britain's problem.
