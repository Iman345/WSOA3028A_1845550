        “At a time when the most vulnerable people are being asked to stay away from others, we are turning to an internet that is bigoted, racist, homophobic and classist for company.”

            This is a quote taken from Sheena Magenya’s recent essay,  Making A Feminist Internet In Africa: Why The Internet Needs African Feminists And Feminisms. The paper tackles issues that marginalized communities face in regards to the internet. Magenya explores the misconception that the introduction of the web and the internet create “equality”. The issues are spoken about in the current context of COVID19 quarantine, speaking to how everyone's solution to combating self isolation is to move to the internet. The move online is assumed to be the most fair and equal solution. However, this is far from being true. Not everyone has the same privilege of access to the internet and technology and not everyone on the internet is treated the same. She therefore voices the concern that the great inequalities that marginalized communities face are not confined to society but echo throughout the internet.

            We see the internet as a magical space where we are free to be ourselves and shape our stories and society. However, this is a huge misconception. The “opression and suppression” of African people, queer people and women alongside other minorities and marganlized communities is not only present in society but exists on the internet as well. The stories, discourses and information on the internet is still largely dominated by the white west.  While the internet provides a space for marginalized people to have a voice, it also serves as a space for bigots, racists, supremacists and homophobes to have a voice and use this power to attack marginalized people. The KKK( Ku Klux Klan) is a notoriously violent and historic American group that seeks to sustain and propel extremely right-winged hetronormative White Christian values and supremacy and participates in hate fueled crimes against people of the black, Jewish, Muslim, LQBTQI+, Hispanic and immigrant communities. While the internet allows marginalised people to connect, share their stories and mobilize for social causes they believe in, the KKK uses the platform to build their community as well. They use the internet to build their member base by being able to reach and target a large database of people who would likely be additions to their group. Mobilizing their force to commit hate crimes online and offline and grow their numbers fast and efficiently.

            The discourses and history of African countries and african people alongside all marginalized people is still puppeteered by Western discourse on them. The Western discourse of these places and people may have no correlation to their reality but that does not matter because the West holds the power to produce their views as fact. They are the leaders in information production on the internet and thus their version of marginalized groups is the view that will dominate their discourse.

            Magenya calls for a plan of action to be implemented to begin to break down these issues and build spaces to combat and tackle the problems of the internet. Magenya calls for more African feminists and feminisms to become dominant voices on the internet and internet culture. WIth movements like the Feminist Principles of the Internet (FPIs) and Making a Feminist Internet in Africa, a call of action is being issued. Female African voices are the driving force the internet sorely lacks but is in dire need of. By gathering powerful female voices and feminists into spaces like the FPI we begin to mobilise forces against the sustained patriarchal and white structure of the internet. Female African voices are able to combat the “single story” that plagues information about Africa, African people and African cultures by sharing their stories and experiences on the internet. Movements like these demand that Africans shape the information and stories about Africa and work to destroy the constructed Western discourse. By creating spaces where more women can speak and be heard, more diverse opinions and perspectives create a space much needed in a white driven Western dominated internet society. Hopefully by continuing and growing these movements will spread across all marginalized communities and begin to grow and diversify the internet or at least increase the power of those it oppressors and enable a space for destruction of the internet's oppressive regimes.
