    <p>I would like to welcome everyone to my blog, bots, government agents , lizard people and local soccer moms alike. This is the blog for the people. Especially the people who know that nothing is ever as it seems to be. This blog is for everyone because it contains something that should be universally shared, the truth. All the conspiracy theories that you think are babel will be shown in a new light, one where you will be less hesitant to call it babel.I will also share my musings on the world I live in as a mixed race women in newly liberated South Africa. Hi my name is Suki Strawberry. That is my god given name my parents don't believe in God or religion so according to them that's the name the energy of the universe gave me. If you are not ready for a life altering journey, turn away now and if you are, you better memorise my words or tattoo them on your back, before the government shuts me down. I don’t wish for more than allies and rebels to be born from this blog.

        <p>The World Wide Web.
            Since Vanevur Bush introduced the theoretical concept of the Memex (Bush, 1945), people have strived to bring the concept to life. Bush’s article “As We May Think” described a machine which could contain, store and retrieve a wealth of data and the way the machine would work would echo that of the human brain through linked pathways using association. This notion of programming information inspired Ted Nelson who was the first person to replicate a similar system through his invention of  Hypertext. Ted Nelson’s invention was central and instrumental in TIm Berners-Lee’s creation of the internet (Mcpherson (2010). Tim Berners-Lee is arguably one of the most significant and important scholars and inventors in the past century because he invented the world wide web (WWW), an invention that has reshaped and evolved society in a great capacity. The World Wide Web or simply the Web was designed by Berners-Lee in 1991 while he was working at CERN (The European Organization for Nuclear Research). While working at Cern Berners-Lee found that information was being handled in an ineffective and inadequately slow manner. This inspired Berners-Lee to fix the way information was being stored and shared. He was particularly obsessed with one of his ideas which led to ENQUIRE and subsequently the Web. Berners-Lee’s specifications of HTML, HTTP and URI(URL) are still being used and developed everyday. Burners-Lee’s vision for the web entailed that it would be accessible and used globally by everyone.
