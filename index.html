    <p>I would like to welcome everyone to my blog, bots, government agents , lizard people and local soccer moms alike. This is the blog for the people. Especially the people who know that nothing is ever as it seems to be. This blog is for everyone because it contains something that should be universally shared, the truth. All the conspiracy theories that you think are babel will be shown in a new light, one where you will be less hesitant to call it babel.I will also share my musings on the world I live in as a mixed race woman in newly liberated South Africa. Hi my name is Suki Strawberry, I am an arts student with a passion for truth, fashion, justice and the demise of the patriachy. If you are not ready for a life altering journey, turn away now and if you are, you better memorise my words or tattoo them on your back, before the government shuts me down. I donâ€™t wish for more than allies and rebels to be born from this blog.
