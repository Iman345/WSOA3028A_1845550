        <p>  The website will be designed to be as accessible to as many people as possible. Therefore all the fonts, animations, sectioning, line spacing and colour schemes will be decided based on inclusion and try and limit exclusion. 
            <p>
           
        </p>
        According to the British Dyslexia Association the two most Dyslexic friendly fonts are Comic Sans and Ariel. For the website Ariel will be used for all blogs and other text including headings. The font will also be written in no smaller than 12 points as the bigger the writing is the easier it is for people who have Dyslexia to read. Italics and underlined words will be kept to a minimum as they make words appear smashed together and become difficult to read for dyslexic users thus having a good spacing between characters, words and paragraphs is essential to try and create a website that the Dyslexic will not be excluded from.
    </p>
        <p>
            The colour pallete of the website will be black, white and grey, there will be no other colour on the website asides from colour in images. No text, headings or backgrounds on the website will contain colour besides black, white or grey. The reason for this is to try and include the Dyslexic, Autistic and colour blind communities as much as possible. Autistic people have heightened senses and thus many bright colours will be distracting. People with dyslexia find reading against a darker backdrop easier than distracting colourful backdrops. People with colour blindness or visual impairments may not be able to recognise text in certain colours thus the use of colour is kept to a minimum.

        </p>
         <p>
            In compliance with trying to include the above mentioned groups. The website will try and be as consistent and congruent as possible as consistency is important to the Autistic community as it minimises distraction and keeps focus. Therefore, all buttons and navigation must be the same on all pages. The website will try and stick to a minimalistic style as clutter and creates difficulty for Dyslexic users as well Autistic users. Sectioning between paragraphs and articles must be clear to enhance readability.
