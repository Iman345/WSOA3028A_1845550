        Friday is my favourite day because not only is it the start of my weekend but it's the day my club meetup and my favourite sushi place has a buffet special. So I generally wake-up at 7am for my 10am philosophy lecture. I brush my teeth with colgate and I wash my face with cold water. I do my face routine and hop in the shower. I do not believe in baths. They do not clean you and it's a waste of water to take a bath and then hop in a shower. Baths are killing the earth and that's why I do not support the trend of bath bombs. Next I meditate in my towel and check my satellite radio to see if any extraterrestrial life decided to respond to the messages I frequently relay.

        Next I choose my outfit, every Friday I choose my most dramatic outfit so it'll probably include a cape or a corset. I wear my outfit, put my face cream on and have breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day according to the inside of the chappies rapper. So I make myself a hearty bowl of two minute noodles and I chop some celery sticks to eat with my hummus as a starter because I am a health nut like that. I am not the only one I have to feed, I have my lil cat, Aries. I then pull up pinterest to choose a tumblresque gothic makeup look and try to duplicate it on my face. Sometimes I comb my hair and make it look cute but sometimes I just decide that the grumpy professor doesn't care about my hair and no one really comes for the 10 am lecture anyway. I pack my lunch peanut butter sandwich with my choice of fruit, normally grapes. Then I listen to an empowering song like Abba's dancing queen or really any Pussy Riot song and I pack my bag for the day. I kiss my cat, grab my water bottle, lock my door and hop on my scooter. I scoot to school, if anyone hoots at me i have to stop to cry a little and then i continue my journey, I always wear a helmet btw.  Once at school I attend my lectures and observe to see if anyone has followed me, logging any suspicious characters. I then enjoy my lunch and prepare for my afternoon club.

        I save my most dramatic outfit for this day because this is when our club meets in the NorthWest library. We are currently four members including myself. We are the The Third Eye Society. My members are myself, my best friend Ken, the librarian Eunice and a film kid who just joined because he is crushing on Ken.  We talk conspiracy, lizard people, spies see if Anonymous has replied to our emails and wants to join our allegiance. I tell them of suspicious characters to be wary of and at the end of the meeting, I gift everyone with an easter egg and confirm our meeting for next week.

        I then go home. Take off my make-up. Stalk my crush for a bit. Order a vegetarian pizza with extra garlic so the vampires do not get me, Friday is an opportune day for their hunting so we gotta be extra careful. I cuddle my cat, read the news and fall asleep to the calming sounds of Didgeridoo song covers.
